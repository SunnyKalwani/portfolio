Sophisticated intro-
	Hi, I am Sunny Kalwani. Project Management has always been one of my key strengths, proficiently applied in both the retail and healthcare industries. I started my career as a Management Professional, and in my journey as a manager, I realized that web development is my true passion. Over the years, I have honed my skills as a imaginative and creative full stack web developer by actively engaging with projects from B2C and B2B realms.
